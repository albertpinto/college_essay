**Rika Pinto: A Journey from Jewelry Design to Filmmaking**

In the heart of the bustling jewelry industry, I found my first love for storytelling—not through film, but through precious metals and gemstones. As the CEO and Founder of Romikas, a retail jewelry business, I spent countless hours crafting intricate designs, curating stories through my products, and leading a dynamic team. Each piece of jewelry I designed was born from a narrative, a mini-film embedded in silver and gold that resonated with over 5,000 customers within three years. This journey illuminated my path towards film and cinema, revealing the potent power of visual storytelling.

Leadership in Romikas required more than managerial skills; it demanded empathy and innovation. During the pandemic, sourcing materials became a significant challenge. With my team’s morale teetering, I fostered a culture of adaptability. We explored alternative suppliers and ensured business continuity. Concurrently, we amplified our social responsibility efforts, donating 10% of sales to GiveIndia for oxygen tanks and the Trevor Project for LGBTQ+ support. These initiatives not only bolstered our brand reputation but also showcased how impactful narratives could inspire change. This pivotal experience solidified my resolve to captivate audiences, a skill I plan to refine in the realm of film studies.

Teaching Abacus Math at Brain-O-Magic was another dimension of my creative endeavor. I led over 200 students to victory in the Speedy Math State Competition. However, beyond the numbers, the real victory was in building confidence and fostering a love for learning. Teaching for free for a month and raising over $1,000 for Ukrainian children further taught me the importance of engaging narratives and the capacity to inspire. These experiences will inform my approach to filmmaking, where each scene and dialogue must engage and enlighten the audience.

Simultaneously, my screenplay writing flourished. For three years, I poured my life’s vignettes into a pilot script, exploring characters and narratives deeply imbued with my experiences. This prepared me for the structured and detailed world of filmmaking, a field where I intend to bring stories that are rich, diverse, and impactful.

Music and dance have also been integral parts of my creative journey. Training in Ballet, Jazz, Tap, and Contemporary, performing at Warriors games, and scripting a solo dance to Beyoncé’s “Bigger” honed my sense of rhythm and expression. This artistic versatility, from visually engaging jewelry designs to animated dance performances, underscores my storytelling prowess.

Volunteering at Valley Humane Society added another layer to my narrative understanding. Engaging with animals, understanding their silent stories, and nurturing them towards adoption fostered a deep empathy. This perspective is vital for creating believable characters and narratives that resonate with audiences.

These multifaceted experiences coalesce into a unique perspective I bring to the Film/Cinema/Video Studies program. With an entrepreneurial spirit, a storyteller’s heart, and a background rich in creative expression, I am poised to contribute a fresh, insightful voice to the academic discourse. My journey from jewelry design to filmmaking epitomizes the convergence of art and business, creativity, and pragmatism—an essential blend for successful storytelling in cinema.

Ultimately, my goal is to harness this storytelling prowess to create films that not only entertain but also inspire and transform. I am excited to further refine these skills at your esteemed institution, where I hope to learn, grow, and contribute to the vibrant tapestry of film and cinema.
