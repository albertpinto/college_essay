# Rika Pinto's Film/Cinema/Video Studies Application Essay

As a child, the flicker of a film reel’s light projected stories that transported me to different worlds. This early fascination with cinema set me on a journey that has been shaped by numerous roles and experiences, ultimately leading me to seek a formal education in Film/Cinema/Video Studies. My name is Rika Pinto, and I have spent the last few years navigating various ventures that collectively reflect my passion for storytelling, creativity, and leadership.

One of my most formative experiences has been as the CEO, Founder, and designer of Romikas, my retail jewelry business. In this role, I have had the privilege of blending artistic expression with strategic acumen. From designing unique jewelry pieces to mastering product photography and developing engaging social media content on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, I have built a brand that resonates with over 5,000 customers. However, running Romikas has been about more than just business; it has been a platform for positive change. By donating 10% of our monthly sales to charities such as GiveIndia and the Trevor Project, I’ve been able to address pressing social issues while inspiring my team and community. This leadership experience has solidified my belief in the power of creative endeavors to catalyze societal impact.

Parallel to my entrepreneurial journey, I have found immense joy and fulfillment in teaching. As a Lead Teacher at Brain-O-Magic, where I taught over 200 students Abacus Math, I discovered my knack for inspiring young minds. Leading students to win the Speedy Math State Competition and fostering their confidence in a safe learning environment were accomplishments that enriched my life. Teaching for free for a month and raising over $1,000 for Ukrainian children further underscored the profound impact of education and community service. These experiences have honed my ability to connect with and mentor others, a skill I intend to bring to any collaborative academic setting.

Moreover, my research internship at Support Vectors with Asif Qamar, a past UC Berkeley AI and Data Science professor, was a pivotal educational opportunity. This internship allowed me to delve into data analysis, researching how holidays affect sales using linear regression. Publishing my findings in the CODATA Science Journal was a testament to my analytical capabilities and commitment to academic rigor. Overcoming the complex challenges of this project deepened my understanding of the practical applications of data science in business, further fueling my passion for research.

My creative journey extends to the performing arts as well. As a guest star in the YouTube Red Series "Escape the Night" and through various auditions for prominent shows like "Grey’s Anatomy" and "Stranger Things," I have explored different dimensions of storytelling. These experiences have honed my acting skills and provided a profound understanding of character development and narrative construction, essential elements in film studies.

Combining my leadership, creative, and academic pursuits, my volunteer work at the Valley Humane Society and as a Vet Assistant has been equally rewarding. Increasing adoption rates by socializing animals and assisting veterinarians have taught me the values of empathy and responsibility.

In pursuing a degree in Film/Cinema/Video Studies, I aim to integrate these diverse experiences, leveraging my entrepreneurial spirit, teaching prowess, and passion for the arts. My journey has been characterized by a relentless pursuit of excellence, both in creatively telling stories and in making tangible impacts on my community. I am eager to bring my unique blend of skills and experiences to the University of California, where I hope to further my understanding of film and explore new avenues of storytelling that inspire and affect change.
