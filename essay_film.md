# University of California Film/Cinema/Video Studies Application Essay

It was a sweltering summer afternoon when I first held my father’s vintage Super 8 camera, a relic from his youthful adventures. As soon as I heard the mechanical whirring of the film loading, I was captivated. This was more than an object; it was a portal to a world where stories came to life. That day marked the genesis of my journey into the world of cinema, transforming a curious teenager into a passionate filmmaker.

My storytelling prowess found an early outlet with Romikas, my jewelry business. While fashioning unique designs, I envisioned each piece as part of a greater narrative—a story of craftsmanship, culture, and connection. My creative expressions extended to filming marketing content for social media, where I captured the intricate details of my jewelry under the soft glow of morning light. These short films became a virtual storefront, attracting over 5,000 customers and allowing me to hone my visual storytelling skills.

Transitioning to screenplay writing felt like a natural evolution. For three years, I meticulously developed a pilot based on my experiences. Each scene was a reimagined memory, each character a reflection of those who shaped me. This venture demanded a deep dive into screenplay structure and character development, skills I refined while pitching my work to production companies.

A pivotal moment in my cinematic journey was guest-starring in the YouTube Red Series "Escape the Night." Being in front of the camera provided an invaluable perspective on the art of direction and performance, enriching my screenwriting endeavors. My passion for film and television also saw me auditioning for roles in FOX pilots and "Grey’s Anatomy," experiences that fueled my desire to bring unexplored narratives to the screen.

My commitment to using film for social impact materialized during my time teaching Abacus Math at Brain-O-Magic. I documented our journey to the Speedy Math State Competition, creating a heartfelt film that showcased the students’ dedication and our collective achievements. This project reinforced the power of film to inspire and leverage positive community engagement.

Combining my entrepreneurial acumen, creative vision, and storytelling expertise, I am eager to contribute to the vibrant cinematic community at the University of California. I envisage a future where my films not only entertain but also enlighten and foster a deeper understanding of our shared human experience.
