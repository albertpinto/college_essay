Throughout my multifaceted journey, I've found that storytelling in its many forms - be it through film, writing, or dance - is the most powerful tool at my disposal. This realization dawned on me while I was acting as a guest star in the YouTube Red Series "Escape the Night." Here, I encountered a significant communication barrier: adapting to the distinct directing styles of various directors. Each had a unique vision, and navigating these often contradictory approaches was challenging. However, this experience taught me the importance of open communication and adaptability. I initiated one-on-one discussions with each director to understand their vision better, ensuring a cohesive performance that resonated with the narrative. This insight solidified my belief in the transformative power of effective communication in film.

One of the most impactful experiences I've had in my burgeoning film career was screen testing for a FOX pilot. The role demanded I convey a character's emotional depth in mere minutes, teaching me the value of preparation and adaptability. I delved into the character's psyche, ensuring that my interpretation aligned with the script's intentions. This experience underscored the importance of detailed preparation and quick thinking, skills that are indispensable in any film production.

My work on the web series "Soci Circle" profoundly influenced my perspective. The seriesâ€™ honest portrayal of social issues highlighted the power of storytelling in creating empathy and inspiring change. Participating in this project reinforced my belief that film is not just entertainment but a medium that can bring about social awareness and transformation.

Collaboration has been the cornerstone of my work, particularly when acting in "Escape the Night." By maintaining open lines of communication with directors, actors, and crew, I contributed to a harmonious and productive set environment. I took part in script readings, rehearsals, and feedback sessions, emphasizing the importance of teamwork in achieving a successful production. 

What excites me most about film/cinema/video studies is its unparalleled ability to evoke emotion and foster connection. This passion has driven me to write and create a pilot based loosely on my life, which I intend to pitch to production companies. Acting in projects ranging from YouTube series to auditions for shows like "Stranger Things" has allowed me to explore different facets of film production, deepening my understanding and love for the craft.

A particularly creative challenge I faced was portraying a complex character within a limited timeframe in "Escape the Night." I addressed this by immersing myself in character research and closely collaborating with directors and co-actors, refining my interpretation and delivery. This experience taught me the importance of thorough preparation and the willingness to learn continuously.

Looking ahead, I envision using my film skills to address pressing social issues. Inspired by my experience with "Soci Circle" and my screenplay writing, I aim to create a documentary focusing on mental health awareness among teenagers. Through personal stories and expert interviews, my objective would be to destigmatize mental health issues and encourage open discussions, contributing to a more understanding and supportive society.

My diverse background as a business owner, teacher, actor, dancer, and screenplay writer uniquely positions me to contribute to the Film/Cinema/Video Studies program. My entrepreneurial experience with Romikas has honed my marketing and design skills, essential for film production. Teaching has enhanced my communication and leadership abilities. Acting has provided me with practical insights into character development, and my dance training adds a unique dimension of physical expressiveness to my performances. These varied experiences and skills will bring a rich, multifaceted perspective to the program, fostering an environment of creative collaboration and innovation.

I am eager to bring my unique experiences, passion for storytelling, and commitment to social change to your Film/Cinema/Video Studies program, contributing to its diversity and enrichment.
