## Film/Cinema/Video Studies Application Essay

Lights, camera, action! These three words have always sent a thrill down my spine, igniting a passion that parallels my entrepreneurial ventures. As the CEO, Founder, and designer of Romikas, a retail jewelry business, I've spent the last three years not only leading a thriving company but also weaving stories through the delicate artistry of jewelry design and the engaging realm of social media. Balancing this role with my passion for film and storytelling has been a fulfilling narrative in itself.

Among the myriad of experiences that have defined my journey, one of the most transformative was penning a screenplay based loosely on my life. Rooted in my entrepreneurial experiences and personal challenges, the story is a tapestry of highs, lows, and the beautiful resilience that life often demands. Writing this screenplay was not just about putting words on paper; it was an exploration of character development, plot intricacies, and the art of capturing real-life essence on screen.

My creative instincts flourish in multiple arenas—whether I'm choreographing an engaging Tik-Tok campaign for Romikas or designing a timeless piece of jewelry. I vividly recall one particular project where I designed a necklace inspired by the Brooklyn Bridge, symbolizing strength and connectivity. The final product wasn’t just a piece of jewelry; it was a story forged in metal and gems, brought to life through meticulous sketches and evocative photography.

In parallel, my role as a screenplay writer has sharpened my storytelling skills. These skills have not only captivated audiences but have also driven the success of Romikas. Narratives imbue our brand's identity, from compelling blog posts to visually striking Instagram content, all contributing to a cohesive and motivating team atmosphere.

UC's Film/Cinema/Video Studies program represents the convergence of my artistic vision and entrepreneurial spirit. It is the ideal environment where I can refine my storytelling prowess and further my quest to create narratives that resonate deeply, both on screen and in the hearts of audiences. I am eager to bring my unique blend of creativity, leadership, and social consciousness to the UC community, to learn, grow, and contribute to the rich tapestry of stories that define human experience.
