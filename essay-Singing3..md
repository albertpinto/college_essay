## Rika Pinto: Charting a Unique Path Through Singing and Leadership

Music has been the cornerstone of my existence, offering a sanctuary for creativity and a platform for expression. As a singer-songwriter, my journey started not merely by striking the right chords or hitting the high notes but by using my voice to influence, lead, and inspire. This narrative is not just an illustration of my artistic journey but a testament to the transformative power of music in shaping leaders and change-makers.

During my tenure as Vice President of the nationally ranked high school show choir, Insync, I discovered that leadership was far more than orchestrating harmonious performances. It was about fostering an environment where each member felt valued and heard. By initiating talent development programs, I enabled experienced members to mentor newcomers, cultivating a culture of mutual respect and support. Our choir’s collective growth and national recognition were a direct result of this cohesion and teamwork. One specific instance that stands out is when we faced a potential conflict over solo parts in an upcoming performance. Instead of dictating decisions, I facilitated open dialogues and group discussions. This approach not only resolved the disputes but also empowered each member, fostering a sense of belonging and collaboration.

While leading the show choir was gratifying, my creative expression found a profound outlet in my songwriting. Writing, recording, and releasing original music like 'The Table,' which received over 15,000 streams in less than a week, was an embodiment of my desire to resonate with audiences on a deeper level. Performing at prestigious venues such as the Young Artist Awards and the Nobel Peace Prize show amplified my commitment to using music as a voice for change. Winning 1st place in the California State Singing Competition for Musical Theater and Pop wasn’t merely a personal triumph but a testament to my relentless pursuit of excellence in merging storytelling and melodies.

Balancing these creative endeavors with my academic pursuits at UC Berkeley has been both challenging and enriching. The analytical and strategic skills honed through my involvement in Nova Consulting have remarkably influenced my approach to my music career. The rigorous demands of acting as CEO and Founder of Romikas, a six-figure profit retail jewelry business, further taught me invaluable lessons in time management, resilience, and innovation. This synergy of creativity and business acumen has equipped me with a unique perspective, enabling me to navigate the complexities of the music industry with finesse.

Moreover, the power of music extends beyond personal and professional achievements; it has been a conduit for making meaningful contributions to my community. Through my singing activities, I have raised awareness and funds for various causes, including educational initiatives for young girls in rural India through Asha for Education. This underscores my belief that music, when coupled with a purpose, can significantly impact society.

What makes me unique, beyond my artistic endeavors, is my relentless drive to blend creativity with leadership, my commitment to using my voice as a catalyst for change, and my ability to navigate and thrive at the intersection of art and business. As I look forward to the possibilities that lie ahead, I am confident that my experiences, passion, and dedication will enable me to contribute richly to the University of California’s diverse and vibrant community.
