### A Symphony of Entrepreneurship and Compassion

Starting a business at 16 might seem daunting, but it became my passion and purpose. As the founder and CEO of Romikas, a retail jewelry business, I embraced my love for design and marketing to resonate with over 5,000 customers. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram became my canvas, where I painted our story through engaging campaigns, blending creativity and innovation.

One memorable moment was resolving a conflict within my team about our marketing direction. By fostering a culture of open dialogue, we merged diverse ideas into a powerful campaign. This taught me the importance of inclusive leadership and how harmony within a team fuels success.

Beyond aesthetics and sales, Romikas stood for social causes. We donated a portion of our revenue to GiveIndia and The Trevor Project, using business as a tool for change. This journey honed my skills in networking and relationship-building, essential for any entrepreneur.

Balancing Romikas with my studies was my greatest challenge. I learned resilience, time management, and the profound impact of perseverance. My research internship at Support Vectors further ignited my passion for economics, applying theories to real-world business problems.

At every step, whether guiding students in Abacus Math or volunteering at the Valley Humane Society, I utilized my skills to improve my community. My journey at Romikas was a symphony of entrepreneurship and compassion, harmonizing business with social good. This interweaving of creativity, leadership, and service makes me eager to further my aspirations in a business program, ready to blend innovation with impact.
