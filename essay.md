title: My Journey with Mathematics: From Teaching to Real-World Impact
---

Leadership, creativity, and a commitment to community are elements that have shaped my journey with mathematics. When I reflect on the experiences that have molded my passion and dedication to this field, one particular instance stands out, guiding students through the fascinating world of Abacus Math.

For four enriching years, I served as a lead Abacus Math teacher at Brain-O-Magic, mentoring over 200 students and seeing many of them excel in the Speedy Math State competition. This role transcended beyond teaching mathematical concepts; it was about instilling confidence, fostering a love for learning, and building a supportive community. I vividly remember staying after class to help a student struggling with a concept or resolving disputes by promoting a spirit of collaboration instead of competition. This experience reinforced my belief in mathematics as a tool for personal growth and intellectual curiosity, not just for me, but for my students as well.

My journey didn't stop at teaching; it extended into the business world where I express my creativity through data analysis for my retail jewelry business, Romikas. Here, mathematics meets artistry. Running Romikas demands innovative thinking and a solid grasp of mathematical principles to optimize marketing strategies. By analyzing data from social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, I identify trends to connect better with my audience. This blend of creative and analytical thinking showcases the versatility of mathematics and its crucial role in real-world applications.

Among my greatest strengths is my ability to teach and inspire, a talent honed through my time at Brain-O-Magic. By integrating games and interactive activities into my lessons, I kept students engaged and motivated. Personalizing my teaching to meet each student's learning style not only improved their performance but also increased their confidence in mathematics. This ability to make mathematics accessible and enjoyable highlights my deep understanding of the subject and my commitment to positively influencing others.

My dedication to mathematics was further solidified during an impactful research internship with Dr. Asif Qamar, a former UC Berkeley AI and Data Science professor. Conducting research on the influence of holidays on sales through linear regression was a daunting challenge. However, through persistence and the guidance of my mentor, I published my findings in the CODATA Science Journal. This experience deepened my understanding of applied mathematics and underscored its real-world significance, driving my enthusiasm for the field.

In summation, my diverse experiences—as an educator, business owner, and researcher—illustrate my unwavering commitment to mathematics. My background marries analytical rigor with creative problem-solving, making me a strong candidate for the University of California. My journey with mathematics has not only been about mastering numbers but also about making a meaningful impact, both academically and within my community, by empowering others with knowledge and confidence.
