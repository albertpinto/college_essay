# Personal Insight Questions

## 1. Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.
In my role as CEO, Founder, and designer of Romikas, a retail jewelry business, I have had numerous opportunities to exhibit leadership and positively influence others. Over the course of three years, I have built a customer base of over 5,000, largely by developing comprehensive marketing, designing, and blogging strategies. I actively engage in every aspect of my business, from writing blogs to taking product pictures, which has allowed me to guide the team effectively and resolve any conflicts that arise. Through the creation of social media content on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, I have not only boosted sales but also used these platforms to amplify charitable causes. I ensure that 10% of our monthly sales are donated to charities like GiveIndia, providing crucial oxygen tanks to India during the pandemic, and the Trevor Project, offering support for LGBTQ+ youth. This approach has created a community environment within Romikas where social responsibility and business success work hand in hand, reinforcing my leadership within and beyond the organization.

As a jewelry designer, I constantly seek inspiration and innovate new product lines that resonate with our customers. Moreover, I harness creativity in developing engaging social media campaigns and writing captivating blogs that not only promote the brand but also tell a compelling story.

By creating a safe and supportive learning environment, I help students to grow their confidence and actively participate, building lasting relationships with them.

The process, from conducting detailed research to drafting a publication-worthy paper, was an educational journey that enhanced my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of data-driven decision-making. This experience also prepared me for future academic pursuits, particularly in research-focused environments.

## 5. Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?

Managing the demands of a growing customer base of over 5,000, alongside rigorous schoolwork, required exceptional time management and prioritization skills. To overcome this, I created a structured daily schedule, allocating specific hours to business tasks, academic work, and personal relaxation time. This disciplined approach ensured that my grades remained high and the business thrived. Despite the challenging workload, I successfully sustained my academic performance while growing a socially responsible business that donates 10% of its sales to charitable causes.

Additionally, my involvement in the Research Internship, where I applied linear regression to study the impact of holidays on sales, showcased my interest in using math for real-world applications. Both teaching and research have allowed me to delve deeper into mathematical concepts and demonstrate their practical significance.
