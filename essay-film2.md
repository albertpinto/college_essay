# Rika Pinto's College Application Essay for Film/Cinema/Video Studies

From a young age, stories have shaped my worldview, but it wasn’t until I started writing screenplays that I understood their immense power. Growing up, I found solace in movies and TV shows, which not only entertained me but also gave me a sense of belonging and the courage to embrace my unique identity. My journey from a childhood film enthusiast to an aspiring filmmaker has been defined by a relentless pursuit of creativity and leadership, which I have channeled into various endeavors.

One of my proudest achievements is founding Romikas, a retail jewelry business, during my sophomore year of high school. As the CEO, Founder, and designer, I wore multiple hats, spearheading our marketing, designing, and blogging strategies. Social media platforms like Tik-Tok and Instagram became my canvas where I painted compelling visuals and narratives to attract over 5,000 customers in just three years. This experience taught me the intricacies of business and the art of storytelling, as every piece of jewelry came with its own tale, much like characters in a screenplay. Moreover, I dedicated 10% of our monthly sales to charities – GiveIndia for pandemic relief and The Trevor Project to support the LGBTQ+ community – blending commerce with compassion.

My enthusiasm for teaching found an outlet as a Lead Teacher at Brain-O-Magic, where I taught over 200 students Abacus Math. Creating an engaging and supportive environment, I helped students discover the joy in numbers and problem-solving. Watching them grow in confidence and ability, and leading them to win the Speedy Math State Competition, was immensely fulfilling. This experience highlighted the importance of patience, empathy, and innovative thinking – qualities that are crucial for a filmmaker.

Another pivotal experience was my role as a Research Intern at Support Vectors under UC Berkeley’s Asif Qamar. I delved into data science, researching how holidays influence sales using linear regression, and published my findings in the CODATA Science Journal. This opportunity not only honed my analytical skills but also showed me the interconnectedness of diverse fields – understanding human behavior through data can enrich storytelling in film.

Balancing my flourishing business with academics was challenging, but it taught me resilience and time management. My disciplined routine allowed me to dedicate 40 hours a week to Romikas while maintaining academic excellence. This balancing act not only prepared me for the rigorous demands of film school but also fueled my creativity.

My journey in acting, from guest-starring in "Escape the Night" to auditioning for shows like "Grey's Anatomy" and "Stranger Things," provided me invaluable insights into the industry. It deepened my performance skills and strengthened my narrative abilities, crucial for a career in film.

Ultimately, what drives me is the desire to tell stories that resonate, inspire, and connect people. Whether through teaching, business, research, or acting, I have always sought to impact others positively and create meaningful experiences. I am eager to bring this passion and dedication to the University of California, contributing to its dynamic community and honing my craft as a filmmaker.

In every project and endeavor, I aim to blend creativity with purpose, storytelling with empathy – a vision I am excited to further at the University of California.
