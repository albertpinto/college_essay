### 1. Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. How did this interaction shape your passion for mathematics?

One significant leadership experience that shaped my passion for mathematics was my role as a lead Abacus Math teacher at Brain-O-Magic. Over the course of four years, I taught over 200 students Abacus Math, guiding many to win the Speedy Math State competition. In this role, I was more than just an instructor; I was a mentor and a role model. I helped students grow their confidence and provided a safe environment where they felt comfortable expressing themselves. 

There were moments when students struggled or felt discouraged, and I would spend extra time with them to clarify concepts and offer moral support. I also resolved disputes among students by fostering a collaborative spirit rather than a competitive one. This interaction reinforced my belief in the power of mathematics as a tool for building confidence and intellectual curiosity, both for myself and for my students. It also solidified my dedication to making mathematics accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

### 2. Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem-solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistic pursuits, among others. Describe how you express your creative side through your study or practice of mathematics.

I express my creative side through mathematics by designing and implementing unique marketing strategies for my retail jewelry business, Romikas. Running a business, especially one that specializes in intricate jewelry designs, requires both creative and analytical thinking. I apply mathematical concepts to optimize my marketing strategies, using data analytics to understand customer behavior and improve sales.

For instance, I use statistics to track the performance of various social media campaigns on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, identifying trends and adjusting my strategies accordingly. This blend of creativity and mathematical analysis enables me to connect with a wider audience and make informed business decisions. Additionally, the intricate design work in jewelry crafting parallels the precision required in mathematical problem-solving, allowing me to merge my artistic and analytical skills seamlessly.

### 3. What would you say is your greatest talent or skill related to mathematics? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?

My greatest talent related to mathematics is my ability to teach and inspire others. This talent has been honed through my extensive experience as a Lead Abacus Math teacher at Brain-O-Magic. Over the years, I have developed innovative teaching methods that make complex mathematical concepts accessible and enjoyable. 

One significant demonstration of this talent was when I led my students to win the Speedy Math State competition. By incorporating games and interactive activities into my lessons, I kept my students engaged and motivated. I also personalized my teaching approach to cater to each student's learning style, which significantly improved their performance and confidence in math. This talent for teaching and inspiring others in math not only highlights my deep understanding of the subject but also my ability to positively influence and elevate others.

### 4. Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced. How has this influenced your interest in and dedication to mathematics?

A significant educational opportunity I seized was my research internship with Asif Qamar, a past UC Berkeley AI and Data Science professor. During this internship, I conducted research on how holidays affect sales using linear regression, a mathematical concept. This experience was not without its challenges; I had to familiarize myself with advanced data analysis techniques and statistical software.

Despite these initial difficulties, I persisted and eventually published my findings in the CODATA Science Journal. This opportunity not only deepened my understanding of applied mathematics but also demonstrated the real-world impact of mathematical concepts. It reinforced my dedication to pursuing mathematics, as I witnessed firsthand how mathematical analysis can provide valuable insights and solutions to real-world problems.

### 5. Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how your interest in the subject developed and how you have further engaged with it, particularly as it relates to your desire to study mathematics.

The subject that inspires me the most is Data Science, which is inherently rooted in mathematics. My interest in Data Science developed during my research internship, where I used linear regression to analyze sales patterns. This experience opened my eyes to the vast possibilities that data analysis and mathematical modeling offer.

Since then, I have engaged further with the subject by taking online courses in statistics and machine learning, both of which heavily rely on mathematical principles. The intersection of mathematics and Data Science excites me because it allows me to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems, driving my desire to study mathematics at a deeper level. My goal is to harness the power of data to make informed decisions and create positive change.

### 6. What have you done to make your school or your community a better place? How have your actions been influenced by your passion for mathematics or its related fields?

I have made significant contributions to my community through my role as a business owner of Romikas and by teaching Abacus Math at Brain-O-Magic. With Romikas, I have used the profits to give back to the community, donating 10% of monthly sales to charities like GiveIndia for providing oxygen tanks during the pandemic and to the Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ hotline.

Teaching Abacus Math has also allowed me to create a positive impact. By providing free lessons for a month and raising over $1,000 to donate to Ukrainian children, I have helped foster a sense of community and support. These actions stem from my belief in the power of mathematics to bring about positive change, whether through direct financial support or by empowering others with mathematical knowledge and confidence.

### 7. Beyond what has been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you an excellent candidate for admissions to the University of California? How does your background and experience with mathematics support your candidacy?

What makes me an excellent candidate for the University of California is my diverse background and proven dedication to mathematics and its applications. My experience as a business owner, Abacus Math teacher, and research intern highlights my ability to apply mathematical concepts in various contexts. 

I have demonstrated leadership, creativity, and a commitment to community service. These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in mathematical analysis, problem-solving skills, and the ability to inspire others. My background shows a unique blend of analytical and creative thinking, making me well-suited to thrive in a rigorous academic environment like the University of California.

### 8. Describe a project or piece of work in mathematics that you are particularly proud of. What challenges did you face, how did you overcome them, and what did you learn from the experience?

One project I am particularly proud of is my research on how holidays affect sales during my internship with Asif Qamar. The primary challenge was understanding and applying complex linear regression models to analyze the data accurately. 

To overcome this, I dedicated extra hours to studying statistical methods and sought guidance from my mentor. I also had to learn to use data analysis software, which was initially daunting but ultimately rewarding. This project taught me the importance of perseverance, attention to detail, and the practical application of mathematical concepts. Successfully publishing my findings in the CODATA Science Journal was a testament to my hard work and deepened my passion for mathematics and data science.
