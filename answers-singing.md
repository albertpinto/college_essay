1. **Describe an example of your leadership experience in singing where you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.**

As an Abacus Math Teacher at Brain-O-Magic, I taught over 200 students and helped them achieve success in competitions like the Speedy Math State Competition. My role required me to cultivate a positive learning environment where students felt confident to express themselves and grow. While not directly related to singing, my teaching experience underscored my ability to lead, motivate, and create a supportive community—skills I have also applied to my singing endeavors. In my school’s choir, I have taken on a leadership role by organizing rehearsals, facilitating group discussions to resolve disputes, and encouraging my peers to believe in their potential. This dual experience in teaching and singing has honed my leadership capabilities, making me a positive influence within both educational and musical groups.

2. **Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem-solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side through singing.**

My creative side shines brightly through my role as a dancer and choreographer, which complements my singing. I have choreographed a solo dance for my school’s dance final to Beyoncé’s "Bigger," allowing me to integrate my love for music and movement. This experience has made my singing performances more dynamic and engaging. Additionally, participating in various acting projects, such as the YouTube Red Series "Escape the Night" and screen tests for shows like "Grey’s Anatomy," has enriched my creative expression. These experiences have allowed me to approach singing with a theatrical flair, making each performance a captivating blend of vocal talent and artistic storytelling.

3. **What would you say is your biggest talent or skill in singing, and how have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?**

One of my biggest talents is my ability to convey emotions through my voice, which has been recognized through awards like "Best Expressions" at the NYCDA dance competition. I have developed this skill over years of performing, starting with my participation in the Kiwanis Burbank Singing Star competition and culminating in being featured in the Nobel Peace Prize Concert with Sting. My commitment to mastering sight-reading and passing the first level in piano with honors at the National Conservatory further demonstrates my dedication to musical excellence. These achievements highlight my ongoing efforts to refine my vocal technique and emotional expression, making me a proficient and emotive singer.

4. **Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced related to your singing aspirations.**

An educational opportunity that significantly impacted my singing was my role as a Lead Teacher at Brain-O-Magic, where I emphasized the importance of confidence and self-expression. Teaching abacus math to over 200 students and helping them win state competitions honed my public speaking and presentation skills. These skills translated seamlessly into my singing performances, enabling me to overcome stage fright and perform with greater confidence. This experience of leading and teaching others has been instrumental in overcoming my initial hesitation in pursuing solo singing opportunities, allowing me to embrace and excel in my musical aspirations.

5. **Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your singing journey?**

The most significant challenge I faced was balancing my responsibilities as the CEO and founder of Romikas, my retail jewelry business, with my singing aspirations. Managing every aspect of the business, from marketing to customer service, demanded immense time and effort. To overcome this, I developed strong time management skills and leveraged social media platforms like Tik-Tok and Instagram to streamline promotional activities. This experience taught me resilience and adaptability, which I applied to my singing journey. Despite my business commitments, I continued to participate in singing competitions and performances, demonstrating my dedication and ability to excel in both areas.

6. **Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how, in relation to singing, you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.**

The academic subject that inspires me is Mathematics, particularly its logical structure and problem-solving nature. My role as a Research Intern, analyzing how holidays affect sales using linear regression, honed my analytical thinking. This analytical mindset has greatly influenced my approach to singing. I apply mathematical precision to understanding musical theory and rhythm, ensuring my performances are technically sound. Additionally, teaching Abacus Math has enhanced my patience and attention to detail, qualities that are invaluable in music. This blend of analytical and creative skills has enriched my singing, allowing me to perform with both technical accuracy and emotional depth.

I have actively contributed to my community by organizing and participating in charity events through my business, Romikas. I donate 10% of monthly sales to charities like GiveIndia and the Trevor Project. While these activities are not directly related to singing, they reflect my commitment to making a positive impact. In my school, my performances at events and talent shows have bolstered school spirit and provided entertainment and joy to my peers and teachers. Additionally, volunteering at the Valley Humane Society to socialize animals has taught me empathy and compassion, qualities I bring to every singing performance, aiming to uplift and inspire my audience.
