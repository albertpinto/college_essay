**Rika Pinto: Harmonizing Leadership and Creativity**

The rhythmic interplay between melody and leadership defines my journey. From leading minds in the classroom to captivating hearts on stage, I let my passion for singing orchestrate the symphony of my life's experiences. Through these myriad roles, I’ve learned that singing is not merely about hitting the right notes but also about harmonizing lives and contributing to a greater good.

**Leadership Beyond the Classroom**

As a Lead Teacher at Brain-O-Magic, I taught over 200 students the intricate patterns of Abacus Math, a role that unexpectedly mirrored my responsibilities as a singer. Every lesson was an opportunity to inspire confidence and cultivate a supportive environment. Whether harmonizing in a choir or mentoring younger singers, I found that my pedagogical approach helped students shine not only in math competitions but also in their self-belief. Teaching for free for a month, raising $1,000 for Ukrainian children, and leading students to win Speedy Math State Math Competitions were milestones that fortified my resolve to use my voice for positive impact.

**A Creative Symphony**

Singing and songwriting are my creative sanctuaries. I express my ingenuity through original works like "Table" and cover songs like "Head Above Water," performed at open mics across Los Angeles, SF, and San Jose. The emotional resonance I incorporate into my performances stems from my deep-seated connection with music. Mentorship from iconic coaches, including Dave Stroud, who once taught Michael Jackson, has been pivotal in refining my craft. This comprehensive training has allowed me to explore new genres and emotions, painting my music with the colors of life experiences.

**From Stage Fright to Spotlight**

Overcoming stage fright was one of the most significant challenges in my singing career. Open mics served as my battlegrounds where I gradually conquered my fears. Interestingly, managing Romikas, my retail jewelry business, required frequent public engagements that boosted my confidence. With every product presentation and social media campaign, I grew more comfortable in front of an audience. Performing at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert with Sting and securing a position as a finalist in the Kiwanis Burbank Singing Star competition were affirmations of my journey from hesitance to self-assuredness.

**Fusing Business Acumen and Artistic Flair**

Business and music may seem worlds apart, but my journey proves otherwise. As the founder and CEO of Romikas, I have leveraged my creative talents to devise innovative marketing strategies that resonate with customers on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. This blend of artistic and business skills underscores my unique perspective on entrepreneurship and consumer engagement. It's this holistic approach that has helped Romikas attract over 5,000 customers in three years.

**Community Impact and Future Aspiration**

Music has been my bridge to community service. Releasing songs that raise awareness, donating a portion of Romikas’ sales to charities like GiveIndia and The Trevor Project, and my role as a vet assistant—all amplify my commitment to making a difference. My endeavors show that singing is not just an art form but a powerful tool for social good.

In conclusion, my multifaceted experiences—from leading educational initiatives and managing a thriving business to conquering personal challenges and contributing to community causes—compose the unique melody that I bring to the University of California. I am enthusiastic about enriching this community with my harmonious blend of leadership, creativity, and altruism.
