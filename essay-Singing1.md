### Rika Pinto: The Melody of Leadership and Resilience

The first time I sang on stage, I felt a symphony of nerves and excitement. At nine, my trembling voice filled the air at the Kiwanis Burbank Singing Star competition, where I emerged as a finalist. That moment ignited a passion that has guided me through a winding path of experiences, blending my love for music with a diverse array of skills that define who I am today.

As the CEO and founder of Romikas, my retail jewelry business, I have transformed creativity into entrepreneurship. Over the past three years, I have acquired over 5,000 customers by personally handling every facet of the business—from designing pieces and crafting marketing strategies to writing engaging blogs and capturing product photos. This entrepreneurial journey has taught me resilience and adaptability, qualities that resonate in my singing pursuits. Juggling a 40-hour work week, school, and music was a challenge that often felt insurmountable. Yet, the discipline I developed from managing Romikas allowed me to dedicate time to my singing, despite the busy schedule.

My leadership extends beyond business. At Brain-O-Magic, where I taught Abacus Math to over 200 students, I discovered the power of mentorship. Creating a supportive learning environment allowed my students to win state-level competitions and grow their confidence. My teaching experience paralleled my role in my school's choir, where I organized rehearsals and fostered a harmonious group dynamic. Each performance, whether on stage or in a classroom, reinforced my ability to elevate the talents of those around me while honing my vocal and leadership skills.

Dancing and acting have further enriched my artistic expression. Choreographing a solo dance to Beyoncé’s "Bigger" showcased my capacity to intertwine song and movement, making my performances more compelling. Acting roles, from YouTube Red’s "Escape the Night" to screen testing for major TV pilots, have added a theatrical flair to my singing, blending vocal prowess with emotional storytelling.

Volunteering at the Valley Humane Society rooted my empathy. Cleaning kennels and socializing animals cultivated a sense of compassion that permeates my musical performances, aiming not just to entertain but to touch hearts. My commitment to giving back extends to charity, donating 10% of Romikas’s monthly sales to causes like GiveIndia and The Trevor Project.

The analytical skills honed during my research internship at UC Berkeley, where I studied the impact of holidays on sales, also fuel my music. The precision of data analysis parallels my approach to musical theory and rhythm, ensuring each performance combines technical accuracy with emotive depth.

Awards, from being featured in the Nobel Peace Prize Concert with Sting to winning “Best Expressions” at NYCDA, validate my dedication and growth as a singer. The intersection of my entrepreneurial, teaching, and artistic experiences has sculpted me into a well-rounded individual who is ready to excel in a rigorous university music program.

My journey is a melody of leadership, creativity, and resilience, with each note contributing to a harmonious whole. At the University of California, I am eager to bring my diverse skills and passions to your esteemed music program, ready to harmonize my strengths with the opportunities that await.
